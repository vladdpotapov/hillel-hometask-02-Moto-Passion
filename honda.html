                Honda is the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Japan and has been since it started production in 1955. At its peak in 1982, 
                Honda manufactured almost three million motorcycles annually. By 2006 this figure had reduced to around 550,000 but was still higher 
                than its three domestic competitors.
                In 2017, India became the largest motorcycle market of Honda. In India, Honda is leading in the scooters segment, 
                with 59 percent market share.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first of these explanations was put forward when, in 1975, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) was commissioned by the UK 
                government to write a report explaining why and how the British motorcycle industry had been out-competed by its Japanese 
                competitors. The report concluded that the Japanese firms, including Honda, had sought a very high scale of production 
                (they had made a large number of motorbikes) in order to benefit from economies of scale and learning curve effects. It 
                blamed the decline of the British motorcycle industry on the failure of British managers to invest enough in their businesses 
                to profit from economies of scale and scope.
                <br>
                <br>
                The second explanation was offered in 1984 by Richard Pascale, who had interviewed the Honda executives responsible for the 
                firm's entry into the U.S. market. As opposed to the tightly focused strategy of low cost and high scale that BCG accredited to Honda, 
                Pascale found that their entry into the U.S. market was a story of "miscalculation, serendipity, and organizational learning" â€“ in other
                words, Honda's success was due to the adaptability and hard work of its staff, rather than any long term strategy. For example, Honda's 
                initial plan on entering the US was to compete in large motorcycles, around 300 cc. Honda's motorcycles in this class suffered performance and 
                reliability problems when ridden the relatively long distances of the US highways. When the team found that the scooters they were 
                using to get themselves around their U.S. base of San Francisco attracted positive interest from consumers that they fell back on selling the 
                Super Cub instead.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most recent school of thought on Honda's strategy was put forward by Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad in 1989. Creating the 
                concept of core competencies with Honda as an example, they argued that Honda's success was due to its focus on leadership in 
                the technology of internal combustion engines. For example, the high power-to-weight ratio engines Honda produced for its 
                racing bikes provided technology and expertise which was transferable into mopeds. Honda's entry into the U.S. motorcycle market 
                during the 1960s is used as a case study for teaching introductory strategy at business schools worldwide
