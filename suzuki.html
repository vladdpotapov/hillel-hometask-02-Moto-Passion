                    Suzuki started manufacturing motorcycles in 1952, the first models being motorized bicycles. From 1955 to 1976 the 
                    company manufactured motorcycles with two-stroke engines only, the biggest two-stroke model being the water-cooled triple-cylinder GT750.
                    A large factor in Suzuki's success in two-stroke competition was the East German Grand Prix racer Ernst Degner, who defected to 
                    the West in 1961, bringing with him expertise in two-stroke engines from the East German manufacturer MZ. The secrets Degner
                    brought with him were the work of Walter Kaaden, who combined three crucial technologies for the first time: the boost port, 
                    the expansion chamber, and the rotary valve.
                    Suzuki hired Degner, and he won the 50 cc class FIM road racing World Championship for them in the 1962 season. Suzuki became the first 
                    Japanese manufacturer to win a motocross world championship when Joel Robert won the 1970 250 cc title. In the 1970s, Suzuki established 
                    themselves in the motorcycle racing world with Barry Sheene Marco Lucchinelli1981 Franco Uncini1982 winning world championships in the 
                    premier 500cc class.
                    In 1976 Suzuki introduced its first motorcycles since the Colleda COX of the 1950s with four-stroke engines, the GS400 and GS750.
                    In 1994, Suzuki partnered with Nanjing Jincheng Machinery to create a Chinese motorcycle manufacturer and exporter called Jincheng Suzuki.
                    Suzuki continued to compete in MotoGP and last won the title in the 2000 season. From 2006 to 2011, the team was sponsored by Rizla and 
                    was known as Rizla Suzuki MotoGP team. On 18 November 2011, Suzuki announced that the GP racing was suspended, partly due to natural disasters 
                    and recession, until 2014. Suzuki returned to MotoGP in 2015.
                    In addition Suzuki have recorded a total of 93 victories at the Isle of Man TT Races. Suzuki have also taken the runner up spot 
                    in the various race categories 100 times and a total 92 third places.

                    GS series – The 1976 GS750 was the first 4-stroke machine released by Suzuki in 20 years. The following year saw Suzuki's first 1-liter machine, the 
                    GS1000E, and then in 1979 the GS1000S copy of a Yoshimura GS1000 Superbike.
                    Katana – The GSX1100S was released in Europe in 1980; the GSX1000S arrived in the U.S. and Canada later that year as a 1981 model, and revolutionized 
                    sportbike styling. A 1982 Katana GS1000SV is on the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame's list of "classic bikes" that have been shown in the museum,
                    and was in The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition.
                    GSX-R750 was one of the Japanese sport bikes of the 1980s that began the modern race replica era.It had air/oil cooling, light weight, and a powerful 
                    engine. The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan (in Japanese) includes the 1984 Suzuki GSX-R750 as one of their 240 Landmarks of Japanese 
                    Automotive Technology, and was in The Art of the Motorcycle.
                    Intruder 750 with its OHC 4-valve 45° V-twin engine was the first Japanese cruiser motorcycle (designed to appeal to U.S. riders) in 1985. By 1997, 
                    cruiser-style motorcycles would account for nearly 60 percent of the U.S. street-bike market.
                    GSX-R1100, related to the GSX-R750, appeared in 1986. The same basic engine would reappear in 1995 to power the Bandit 1200 and remain in 
                    roduction through 2006.
                    The DR-BIG aka Desert Express DR800S (in German) off-roader was existent for two model years as the DR750S (in German) until 1990, when its displacement 
                    increased to 779cc, still the world largest single cylinder engine in a production motorcycle. Available in Europe through 1999, it was not exported 
                    to the U.S. market. Replaced by the V-Strom twin, the DR-BIG has now come full circle as the design inspiration for a 2014 overhaul of the V-Strom 1000 
                    ABS.

                    Suzuki RF Series The Suzuki RF series are sport touring motorcycles. They came with three engine variations: 400, 600 and 900 cc. It was in 
                    production from 1994 to 1998.
                    TL1000S debuted at the 1996 International Motorcycle and Scooter Show as the first Suzuki sport bike with a V-twin engine. This was a 
                    liquid-cooled, 90° V-twin, DOHC engine with 4 valves per cylinder, which would be in production through 2012. Although the TL1000S motorcycle 
                    ceased production in 2001, the engine would carry on in the TL1000R, the SV1000 and SV1000S, as well as the V-Strom 1000.
                    GSX-R600 – a smaller version of the GSX-R750. There were earlier pretenders, but the genuine article arrived in 1997 and has received 
                    frequent updates after that.
                    Hayabusa (GSX-1300R) was introduced in 1998, and remains Suzuki's flagship sport bike. The 1998 Suzuki Hayabusa is included in the 
                    JSAE 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology. The development of a second generation Hayabusa for the 2008 model year facilitated 
                    the 2007 roll-out of the GSX-1300BK B-King, a highly stylized naked variant.

                    SV650 was introduced in 1999 as a budget entry in the naked bike market, and since 2001, offered both naked and fully faired. 
                    In 2009 the naked bike version was redesigned and renamed the Gladius in keeping with the sword motif Suzuki established with the Katana. 
                    The Gladius motorcycle won a Good Design Award (aka G Mark) from the Japan Institute of Design Promotion.
                    GSX-R1000 – This top-of-the-line superbike debuted in 2000, and remains the largest model of the GSX-R series.
                    Burgman 650 (AN650) was the largest of a series of urban scooters produced in Japan (marketed as Skywave domestically) as well as in Italy and 
                    Spain with engine capacities of 125cc and up. When it appeared in 2002 the 650 was the largest-displacement scooter in the world, and first two-wheel 
                    vehicle to have an electrically controlled Continuously Variable Transmission.The Japan Institute of Design Promotion awarded the G Mark 
                    Good Design Award to the Skywave 650 in 2003, to the entire Skywave series in 2006 and to the updated Skywave 650LX in 2013.
